##  Java Guide  
lets explain the difference between 
` 
public static void main(string Args){
system.out.println("Hello World")}
`
if the class or method is defined as a `public` it can be accessed from any
where in the program. whether the program is in the same package or different package.
`class Program {
// could be accesed only from this package }`
**Access modifiers**  such as _public_, _private_ and _protected_ can go as a part of method signature or 
as a class level.
